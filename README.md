### A1 Problem Domain: Coordinated Universal Time

The problem domain for this assignment involves time zones, and in particular Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is 'the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time' [Wikipedia]. As you know, there are many different time zones in the world. Wikipedia has a map of the time zones.

As of this writing, there are 40 time zones. One of them, UTC+00:00, is considered to be in the 'middle' of the other time zones. All time zones have names, such as UTC+02:00, that indicate the number of hours and minutes they are away from UTC+00:00. For example, the Philippines are in time zone UTC+08:00 because clocks there are set 8 hours later than in time zone UTC+00:00. If it's noon in time zone UTC+00:00, it's 20:00 in time zone UTC+08:00.
